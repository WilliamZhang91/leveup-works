# levelup-works
Work in progress Student management system using React, Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and Auth0;

Currently, Auth0 is not connected to local database as it requires exposing ip to the internet. However, Sign up and login is up and running. 

Permissions are set depending on whether the user is a student/teacher.

Also includes an upload functionality that allows students to submit images of projects they've completed to the database.
